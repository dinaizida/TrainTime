Project Description:

https://dinaizida.github.io/TrainTime/

A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

When adding trains, users are able to submit the following:

-Train Name
-Destination
-First Train Departue Time -- in military time
-Frequency -- in minutes

Code this app calculates when the next train will arrive; this is relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

- "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" information updates every minute.
- added button to remove train from the schedule table.
